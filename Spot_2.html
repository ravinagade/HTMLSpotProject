            beautiful
            waterfall situated near Vashisht Village in Himachal Pradesh. The fall is formed by a stream which is merged
            in
            to Beas River in the downstream. The waterfall can be reached by trekking from Vashisht Temple. It is among
            popular places to visit in Manali and also one of the famous Places to visit in Himachal. This is one of the

            formed
            by the fall and visitors can take a plunge in the water and spend some time. The flow of the water is
            heaving in
            monsoons and suggested not to adventure into the water during this time. Jogini mata temple is at the base
            of
