        <div style="font-size: x-large;">

            <p><i>Hidimba </i>The Hidimba Devi temple was built in 1553 CE by Maharaja Bahadur Singh.[3] The temple is built around a cave
                where Devi Hidimba performed meditation. Hidimbi was supposed to have lived there with her brother Hidimb,
                and not much is known about their parents. Born into a Rakshasa family, <strong>Hidimba vowed to marry one who would
                defeat her brother Hidimb</strong>, who was supposed to be very brave and fearless. During the Pandava's exile, when
                they visited Manali; Bhima, one of the five Pandavas, killed Hidimb. Thereafter, Hidimba married Bhima and
                gave birth to their son Ghatotkacha.</p>

            <p>The Hidimba Devi Temple has intricately carved wooden doors and a 24-meter-tall wooden "shikhar" or tower
                above the sanctuary.[5] <u>The tower consists of three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth
                brass cone-shaped roof at the top.</u> The earth goddess Durga forms the theme of the main door carvings.[6]
                Also depicted are animals, foliate designs, dancers, scenes from Lord Krishnaâ€™s life and Navagrahas.
                [7]The
                temple base is made out of whitewashed, mud-covered stonework. An enormous rock occupies the inside of
                the
                temple, only a 7.5 cm (3 inch) tall brass image representing goddess Hidimba Devi.</p>

            <p> A rope hangs down in
                front of the rock, and according to a legend, in bygone days religious zealots would tie the hands of
                "sinners" by the rope and then swing them against the rock.[8]

                About seventy metres away from the temple, there is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Hidimba's son,
                Ghatotkacha, who was born after she married Bhima. The most surprising feature of the temple or what
                believers could call the most reassuring feature of the temple is the fact that inside the temple the
                imprint of the feet of the Goddess carved on a block of stone is worshipped.</p>
