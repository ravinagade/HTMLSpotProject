        <div style="font-size: x-large;">

        <p><i><strong>Manu Temple </strong></i>This magnificent temple is dedicated to the sage Manu, who is said to be the creator of the world and the
            writer of Manusmriti. The Manu Temple is located in old Manali, at a distance of <u>three kilometers</u> from the
            main market. Though this area is quite congested, the presence of the River Beas adds to its attraction. The
            temple is one of the prime attractions in Manali and is believed to be the same place where sage Manu
            meditated after stepping on earth. This place has a distinct historical background that appeals to most of
            the people who visit Manali. The popularity of this majestic temple lies in the fact that it is the only
            temple dedicated to Manu; so whoever visits Manali makes it a point to visit this temple. The travelers are
            advised to wear dresses covering the knees and shoulders, while inside the temple.</p>

        <p>Unlike the other temples of its times, Manu temple isn’t for the weak-hearted. Reaching the structure,
            following a narrow road, in itself is a thrilling experience for most. However, for the adventurous ones,
            it’s a perfect blend of exploration and comfort. Constructed in pagoda style, the temple was built after
            <strong>King Manu</strong> who is known worldwide as the initiator of human race. The temple is located in Beas river valley
            in Kullu district and is surrounded by beauty of the most alluring kind. As soon as you step into the porch,
            the fresh and calming air takes over your senses and transfers you another world of religion and
            spiritualism. Manu temple brings you closer to the nature, reminding you there is more to life than just
            money and fame.
